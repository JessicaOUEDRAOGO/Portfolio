# Parkinson VR Simulation

## Overview
This project is a virtual reality simulation designed to raise awareness about Parkinson’s disease by allowing users to experience motor impairments such as hand tremors and difficulties in performing everyday tasks.

The goal is to help users better understand the challenges faced by people living with Parkinson’s disease through an immersive and interactive VR experience.

## Objectives
- Simulate hand tremors and motor instability in a VR environment
- Reproduce everyday tasks affected by Parkinson’s disease
- Promote empathy and awareness through immersive interaction
- Provide an accessible and intuitive VR experience

---

## Experience Description
The user is immersed in a virtual environment where controller movements are intentionally affected by simulated tremors.

Several daily-life activities must be completed, such as:
- Drawing on a virtual board
- Picking up objects
- Placing and manipulating items precisely

These interactions are designed to reflect the motor difficulties experienced by people with Parkinson’s disease, allowing users to better understand their daily challenges.
